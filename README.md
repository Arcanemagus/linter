Linter
==========
The idea is to stop the liters plugins war, by providing top level api for linters to parse and display errors in Atom editor.
This project was inspired by SublimeLinter plugin. So if you liked SublimeLinter, you'll probably like Linter.

*LINTERS ARE NOT INCLUDED* and available as a separate packages. So you will use only linters that you need, or easily code your own.
